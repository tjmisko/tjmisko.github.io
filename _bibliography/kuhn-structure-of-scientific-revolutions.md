This is one of those perennially recommended books for anyone interested in the philosophy and history of science.  The kind of landmark book that has been so thoroughly absorbed into the *zeitgeist* that its conclusions feel almost tautological.  *Structure*'s language of "paradigms" and "paradigm shift" has been so thoroughly appropriated and bastardized in business book circles that encountering that language in its original context still prompted a little bit of an eyeroll from me.

Because I already had a sense of the direction of the argument and the conclusions it would come to, I decided this book would be best to consume as an audiobook.  I was doing a solo 11ish hour trip from Pittsburgh to St. Louis on a hot August day, and I plowed through most of *Structure* on the way.  I went for the Dennis Holland narration, which was fairly neutral and unmemorable as far as I can recall.  

To write this annotation, I'm drawing on a couple of summary sources as well as some sparse notes I made at the time.  


## Paradigms as Prevailing Models of Thought

## There Is No Perfect Theory

I remember feeling distinctly uncomfortable as I sat in my ECON 2 lectures in Freshman year.  The temperature of the room was pleasant, and the chairs in which I sat were usually good enough.  My discomfort was distinctly mental.  The models being used were a bit *too* simple, and surely we could do better.  How could all of these brilliant economists not realize that these models were grossly oversimplifying? And might not all of the issues in economics be solved by simply including more factors in the models?  Surely we could do better.

I look back on that view as rather quaint and naive now, and reading *Structure* was the death knell for the last vestiges of that strain of my thinking.  Kuhn's accounts of the ways in which 

## The Path Dependence of Thought

*Structure* prompted me to think more seriously about the history of thought.  In particular, it got me thinking seriously about the ways in which the models available to me  

As I've mentioned many times, I got my start as a physical reductivist steeped born of a blind scientism.  In my teenage years, I was that hubristic sort of interlocutor who would frequently appeal to "objective reality" and reject any appeals to authority.  

Kuhn's work forced me to confront just how dynamic scientific understanding is.  You can't make an appeal to "objective reality" based on science in good faith if, as Kuhn claims, the development of science is not simply the filling out or resolving of a stable representation of reality.

In Kuhn's account, the "filling in the picture" metaphor describes the "normal" or "puzzle-solving" phase of the scientific process.  It's no accident that that was what I imagined science to be: that portrayal is dominant in popular representations, and I'd never really lived through a big, paradigm shifting "revolution" in physics, which the discipline with which I was best acquainted.
