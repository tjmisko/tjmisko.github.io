*The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* is one of those perennially recommended books for anyone interested in the philosophy and history of science.  *Structure*'s language of "paradigms" and "paradigm shift" has been so thoroughly appropriated and bastardized in business book circles that encountering that language in its original context prompted a little bit of an eyeroll from me.  But the ideas here really are worth thinking about.  

Because I already had a sense of the direction of the argument and the conclusions it would come to, I decided this book would be best to consume as an audiobook.  I was doing a solo 11ish hour trip from Pittsburgh to St. Louis on a hot August day, and I plowed through most of *Structure* on the way.  I went for the Dennis Holland narration, which was fairly neutral and unmemorable as far as I can recall.  

To write this annotation, I'm drawing on a couple of summary sources as well as some sparse notes I made at the time.[^1] 

## There Is No Perfect Theory

I remember feeling distinctly uncomfortable as I sat in my ECON 2 lectures in Freshman year.  The temperature of the room was pleasant, and the chairs in which I sat were usually good enough.  My discomfort was distinctly mental.  The models being used were a bit *too* simple, and surely we could do better.  How could all of these brilliant economists not realize that these models were grossly oversimplifying? And might not all of the issues in economics be solved by simply including more factors in the models?  Surely we could do better.

I look back on that view as rather quaint and naive now, and reading *Structure* was the death knell for the last vestiges of that strain of my thinking.  I was looking for a perfect theory, one that has perfect explanatory power.

*Structure* takes a position that describes science not as the quest for a perfect model, but a model that is good enough.  Good enough is, in usual times, good enough.  But, as Kuhn shows through historical examples, and as I felt distinctly in my introductory economics course, our models and theories reify and replace our perception of reality if we spend too much time operating inside of them.  We become so accustomed to our models that, when we receive evidence that they are no longer good enough, we dig in our heels, and we "[stand] athwart history, yelling Stop" when faced with a new model that threatens our old familiar ones.[^2]

Kuhn's identification of this conservative impulse among practicing scientists really stuck with me.

## Paradigms as Prevailing Models of Thought

## The Path Dependence of Thought

*Structure* prompted me to think more seriously about the history of thought.  In particular, it got me thinking seriously about the ways in which the models available to me  

As I've mentioned many times, I got my start as a physical reductivist steeped born of a blind scientism.  In my teenage years, I was that hubristic sort of interlocutor who would frequently appeal to "objective reality" and reject any appeals to authority.  

Kuhn's work forced me to confront just how dynamic scientific understanding is.  You can't make an appeal to "objective reality" based on science in good faith if, as Kuhn claims, the development of science is not simply the filling out or resolving of a stable representation of reality.

In Kuhn's account, the "filling in the picture" metaphor describes the "normal" or "puzzle-solving" phase of the scientific process.  It's no accident that that was what I imagined science to be: that portrayal is dominant in popular representations, and I'd never really lived through a big, paradigm shifting "revolution" in physics, which the discipline with which I was best acquainted.

This is an absolutely fascinating document to read in 2023 because of the insight into the deep intellectual and emotional currents underpinning the American right to this day.  There are sentences in this piece that could be taken out of a Tucker Carlson vamp.
