                and build things.

        <h1 class="site-header" id="about-me"> About Me </h1>
        <h2 class="about-headers"> My Mission </h2>
        <p class="first"> I am passionate about building systems within which
            data can be used to answer questions and improve people's lives. </p>
        <h2 class="about-headers"> The Extraordinary Promise and Pernicious Seduction of Data </h2>
        <p class="first"> Through the research work I've done in economics, I
            have come to appreciate both the extraordinary power and severe
            limitations of data.
        </p>
        <p class="next">
            <!-- Data offers an epistemological solution to complexity by allowing
            us to quantify the relationships between things.   -->
            When trying making decisions, we often overwhelmed by complexity,
            lacking the information we need to answer basic questions:
            <ul>
                <li> Which relationships between things are important? </li>
                <li> What category does something belong in? </li>
                <li> What deserves our attention? </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="first">
            Data admits precise, reproducible analysis that promises to "cut
            through the noise" and answer these questions for us within an
            internally consistent framework.
        </p>
        <p class="next">
            And it almost always delivers on this promise, furnishing us with the
            information we need to make better decisions and understand ourselves,
            our world, and the relationships that drive it.
        </p>
        <p class="next">
            But data gives us exactly what it promises and nothing more.
            <!-- The internal consistency and mathematical precision that
            analysis offers can give license to a kind of epistemological
            hubris. -->
            When we think analytically, we can only see our data
            points, our models, and the answers they suggest.   And soon enough
            we forget that the questions data answers are fundamentally
            <b>reductive</b>: categorization and regression flatten out all
            nuance and complexity <i>by design</i>.
        </p>
        <p class="next">
            We all know this,The data points that matter become metrics, and, when we optimize
            on these metrics, they become our values.
            But with people oftentimes the "noise" we are trying to cut through
            is the most important part.
        </p>
        <h2> Closing the Distance Between Data</h2>
        <p class="first">

            But, as we bring data to bear on human questions, it is imperative
            to remember that   Of course, this is a feature and not a bug.

        </p>
        <p class="next">
            When we crush people down into a single row in a csv, when we
            In particular, I think of data as a flattening of
            all the complexity and nuance of reality onto a low
            dimensional space.  Sometimes, this flattening keeps most of
            the signal
