* Implemented a causal regression analysis design in R to evaluate the effect of negative air quality shocks on housing prices
* Matched geospatial wildfire smoke data from NOAA (~28,000,000 observations) to housing price data from Zillow (~98,000 observations) at the US county-month level and salient control variables to synthesize a novel dataset for model estimation
* Accounted for spatial autocorrelation of observations to reduce omitted variable bias and generate plausibly causal estimates
