* Scraped HTML and JSON data in Python to construct and categorize a 60,000 observation dataset on national-level policies and regulations on air quality across the OECD
* Developed a model for separately estimating the effect of different policy categories on different pathways for the reduction of air pollution
* Conducted a time series regression analysis of the relationship between air quality policy data and air quality outcomes in R to evaluate which policy categories were most effective at reducing air pollution in the period
