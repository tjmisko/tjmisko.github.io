* Scraped HTML and JSON data from the web using Pythonâ€™s xpath library to construct a 60,000 observation dataset on country level policy on air quality across the OECD
* Developed a novel theoretical model for separately estimating the effect of policy on different pathways for the reduction of air pollution
* Conducted a time series regression analysis of the relationship between air quality policy data and air quality outcomes in R to assess the kinds of policies which are most effective at reducing air pollution
