- Implemented a causal regression analysis design in R to evaluate the effect of negative air quality shocks on housing prices
- Matched geospatial wildfire smoke data from NOAA (28,000,000 observations) to housing price data from Zillow (98,000 observations) at the US county-month level and salient control variables
- Accounted for spatial autocorrelation of observations to reduce omitted variable bias and generate plausibly causal estimates
