* Led a complete redesign of the SSPI database, data collection procedures, and data validation processes 
* Implemented a full stack web application for data collection, management, and validation which compiles data from dozens of reporting sources, seamlessly handles different formats, and allows automatic validation procedures that ensure the local SSPI database is correct and up-to-date
* Database improvements have cut manual data entry and validation time by an order of magnitude, removing a major project bottleneck
* Led four undergraduates through their first software and data engineering project by creating tutorials and offering mentoring sessions for tools like git, GitHub, Python, Flask, SQL, and MongoDB
