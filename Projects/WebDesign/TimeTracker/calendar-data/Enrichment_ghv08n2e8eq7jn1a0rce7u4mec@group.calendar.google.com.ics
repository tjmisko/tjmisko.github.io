DESCRIPTION:<html-blob>Read Sontag\, "Pilgrimage" in its entirety with some
  notes in the margins.&nbsp\; The style was interesting\, like a personal e
 ssay\, but it's a fictional short story.&nbsp\; I loved the portrayal of th
 e self-styled precocious teenage intellectuals\, it really resonated with t
 he way I understood myself.&nbsp\; The recognition that idolization was a w
 ay of escaping the confines of childhood resonated with my understanding of
  Angie and the way she idolizes people.&nbsp\; But of course Angie is inter
 esting because she's now found herself returning to childhood media\, and s
 he longs for a return to that state of chaste innocence and uncomplication.
  Or at least that's how it looks to me.<br><br>Merrill as a character\, wit
 h all his flatness and his going along with the narrator's whims and his se
 lf-delusion and his insincere idolization\, really cut deep into a part of 
 who I was\, which got me thinking about what my relationship to my own chil
 dhood was.<span>&nbsp\;It was certainly more complicated than the narrator'
 s feeling of imprisonment\, but I was trying to throw off the shackles and 
 avoid the trappings of childishness even from an early age.&nbsp\; There wa
 s no <i>Spongebob </i>or <i>Harry Potter\,</i>&nbsp\;and I didn't want to h
 ear Ben's YouTube videos even if I thought they were funny.&nbsp\; I would 
 feign forgetfulness of them.&nbsp\; So curious\, the human animal.&nbsp\;&n
 bsp\;</span><br><br><span>Of course there were things about my childhood th
 at were childish.&nbsp\; <i>Family Guy</i>&nbsp\;and <i>Minecraft </i>and&n
 bsp\;<i>Call of Duty</i>&nbsp\;and Kesha&nbsp\;and pornography consumed in 
 unspeakable amounts\, occasionally all at the same time.&nbsp\; Funny these
  register as childish now\, for they are all quite "adult."&nbsp\; What mak
 es them feel childish? Well I did them when I was a child\, so there's that
 .&nbsp\; But more deeply\, with the perspective of a few years' time\, they
  seems silly and bad.&nbsp\; That's what it means to me to look down on som
 ething as childish.&nbsp\; It's about a certain naivety or shallowness that
  I can see but others couldn't or wouldn't.&nbsp\; It's all quite cynical.<
 /span><span>&nbsp\; They were the escapes that a more wholesome childhood w
 ould have furnished me with.&nbsp\;&nbsp\;</span></html-blob>

DESCRIPTION:Listened while reorganizing my room :)\n\nNK Jemison (SciFi aut
 hor) on the ways in which cities are being suburbanized\, and that drives o
 ut the fermenting eclectic mix of interesting people that makes cities real
 ly great.  Interesting debate about the idea of whiteness as a homogenizing
  force\, not an identity.  Flashpoint of Eric Adams\, whom Jemison views as
  an ultimately white supremacist force\, as acting on behalf of and for the
  benefit of a system that favors whiteness not as a racial concept but as a
  pro-European notion of homogeneity.  \n\nI think it really clarifies for m
 e where I depart from that logic.  I do think there is a homogenizing influ
 ence\, and I am definitely part of that: I come down on the side of a set o
 f liberal principles that I do think everyone should hold.  Those principle
 s include tolerance and freedom to express oneself\, but I do think there s
 hould be a vocal rejection of institutions and cultures which reject or wor
 k against those values\, and to the extent to which that project is exclusi
 ve or homogenizing and European in origin\, I am for it.  \n\nThat being sa
 id\, I don't necessarily think that's what she's on about.  It's more about
  making everything comfortable luxury apartments for people who are high up
  in the class structure to feel safe.  Pricing people out of cities is real
 ly bad for the people and the cities and is one of the things I am most ang
 ry about in the city I live in.  That homogenizing influence doesn't seem l
 ike it's about whiteness at all though\, so I'm not sure using that word to
  describe it is really helpful.  It is often true that those two projects a
 re related and practiced by the same people\, but I think that the dynamics
  are different and should be treated as such.

DESCRIPTION:Read Introduction and Chapter 1<br><ul><li>I like his careful\,
  painstaking style for this kind of analysis.&nbsp\; I think he comes acros
 s as a really clear thinker about the subject</li><li>Intelligence as the c
 apacity to take in information and solve problems</li><li>Since natural sel
 ection converged on intelligence in a mechanistic universe\, there's little
  reason to think that machine intelligence is impossible</li><li>Early comp
 uter theorists and AI research focused on rigid symbolic encoding and didn'
 t think too much about the implications of a fully conscious AI system</li>
 <li>AI research went through a series of winters as approaches reached the 
 end of their line\, then new approaches were tried to end the winters</li><
 li>A fundamental problem of AI seems to be the representation of informatio
 n and the chunking of information.&nbsp\; How to see a forest and not a bun
 ch of individual\, infinitely detailed trees.</li></ul>
