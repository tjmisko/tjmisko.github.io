## Running
Ramping back up into training mode currently. I'm looking forward to improving my 800m, mile, 5K, and 10K times before my fast twitch muscle fiber deteriorates any more than it already has.

<!-- I ran a Boston Qualifying [2:59:33](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/872627/Course/1654891/Bib/1289) in the San Francisco marathon in July 2019, placing 3rd in the 19 and under category and 57th overall! I also hold the dubious COVID-era honor of having completed a full 26.2 mile marathon in my house, which took 7:31:42, 3020 laps around the foyer-kitchen-dinningroom loop, and a nontrival portion of the cartilage in my knees. -->

## Woodworking
I like making things out of wood, especially with hand tools. Working on lots of little home-improvement and configuration projects.

## Cooking
I enjoy learning about the art and science of cooking and applying it in my kitchen.  I love cooking food with and for my friends and playing with different cuisines, flavors, and methods.

## Lindy Hop
I started dancing at Lindy on Sproul at UC Berkeley in 2019. I love the dance, the music, and the community of people it brings out! Always working on developing more musicality and refining my leading and following technique.

## Games
I'm a regular player of *Terraforming Mars*, *Arcs*, *Flamecraft*, *Root*, *Wingspan*, and other tabletop games with friends. Games encode, stabilize, and transmit special kinds of shared experiences of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/32137?login=false" target="_blank">agency</a> in a magical and delightful way.

## 学中文
我在学习中文。现在我的词汇不多，语法也很基础，但在慢慢积累。
