## Movement
- **Calisthenics**: Building foundational skills for handstands, planche, and front-lever.
- **Running**: I run everything from 800m to marathons. Currently preparing for a middle-distance training cycle, and hoping to compete at some point in 2026.
- **Lindy Hop**: I started dancing at Lindy on Sproul at UC Berkeley in 2019. I love the dance, the music, and the community of people it brings out! Always working on developing more musicality and refining my leading and following technique.
- **Climbing**: Mostly indoor bouldering, mostly for fun.

## Making
- **Woodworking**: I finding scrapwood and turning it into useful things especially with hand tools. Working on lots of little home-improvement and configuration projects.
- **Cooking**: I enjoy learning about the art and science of cooking and applying it in my kitchen.  I love cooking food with and for my friends and playing with different cuisines, flavors, and methods.

## Miscellany
- **Games**: I regularly play *Terraforming Mars*, *Arcs*, *Wingspan*, *Root*, *Flamecraft*, and other tabletop games with friends. Games encode, stabilize, and transmit special kinds of shared experiences of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/32137?login=false" target="_blank">agency</a> in a magical and delightful way.
- **学中文**： 我在学习中文。现在我的词汇不多，语法也很基础，但在慢慢积累。

<!-- I ran a Boston Qualifying [2:59:33](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/872627/Course/1654891/Bib/1289) in the San Francisco marathon in July 2019, placing 3rd in the 19 and under category and 57th overall! I also hold the dubious COVID-era honor of having completed a full 26.2 mile marathon in my house, which took 7:31:42, 3020 laps around the foyer-kitchen-dinningroom loop, and a nontrival portion of the cartilage in my knees. -->
