## My Values
 
### Collaboration and conversation
Bringing people  together to solve problems makes for better solutions and stronger teams.  I do my best to model clear communication, respect, patience, and empathy with my collaborators.

### Open-mindedness 
For collaboration to yield fruitful results, we must remain open to changing our minds, to being convinced by a good argument, and to seeing what is good in an argument with which we disagree.  Our values define us, not our beliefs.  [When the facts change, we ought to change our minds.](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/22/keynes-change-mind/)

### Playfulness and experimentation
We learn best by pushing against the boundaries and trying things that might (and probably will) fail.  Play enables us to throw off constraints, question assumptions, and be creative.

### Groundedness
The ultimate goal of work, society, the economy, etc. is to serve people and the planet.  It's easy to get lost up in the clouds or down in the weeds when we're working hard on something.  Keeping a clear focus on the goals of the work I'm doing and the tangible benefits that achieving those goals will confer ensures that I'm making a meaningful and impactful contribution in the world.
