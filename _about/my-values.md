## Open-mindedness, Curiosity, and Experimentation
Surprise and discovery are delightful
- Not minimizing surprise.

## Collaboration, Conversation, and Diversity
Bringing people to build things makes them better. Clear communication, respect, patience, and empathy with my collaborators.

## Playfulness, curisosity, and experimentation
We learn best by pushing against the boundaries and trying things that might (and probably will) fail.  Play enables us to throw off constraints, question assumptions, and be creative.

## Groundedness
Work, society, and the economy to serve people and the planet. Abstractions matter, but not as much as people do. It's easy to get lost up in the clouds or down in the weeds when we're working hard on something. Keeping a clear focus on the goals of the work I'm doing and the tangible benefits that achieving those goals will confer ensures that I'm making a meaningful and impactful contribution in the world.
