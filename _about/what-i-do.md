## My Mission

What do we know? How do we know what we know?  How do we fit that knowledge into what we already profess to know? How do we deploy that knowledge in accordance with our values?  I'm passionate about building systems within which data and technology can be used to help people answer questions like these to make better decisions.

## My Approach
I strongly believe that there is no one discipline to deploy when working at the interface between people and technology.  I strive to bring data science, software engineering, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and good old-fashioned empathy for humans together when developing systems and solutions.  

All disciplines build models and use metaphors to understand the world.  Understanding what these models have to offer and where they fall short forms the epistemological core of my approach.

## My Skills
* Mathematical excellence and problem solving ability applied to statistics, data science, computer science, and economics
* Robust communication with good oral presentation skills and thoughtful technical and non-technical writing
* Project management, delegation, and prioritization honed across diverse project environments
* Teaching and mentoring focused on developing conceptual understanding and building the confidence needed to take on problems.
* Close reading and critical analysis of argumentation, form, and content of texts
