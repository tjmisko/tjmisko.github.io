## My Mission

I am passionate about building systems within which data and technology can be used to help people answer questions and make better decisions.  I firmly hold that there is no one approach to take in achieving this goal.  I strive to bring data science, software engineering, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and good old-fashioned empathy for humans and their stories into productive conversation.  

## My Values
* *Collaboration and conversation*:
* *Open-mindedness*: For collaboration to yield fruitful results, . Defensiveness is our natural reaction.
* *Abstraction and Grounding*:

## Technology, People, and Society

How do people make decisions?

## The Extraordinary Promise and Pernicious Seduction of Data

Through the research work I've done in economics, I have come to appreciate both the extraordinary power and severe limitations of data.

Data offers an epistemological solution to complexity by allowing us to quantify the relationships between things.  

When trying making decisions, we often overwhelmed by complexity, lacking the information we need to answer basic questions:
    * Which relationships between things are important?
    * What category does something belong in?
    * What deserves our attention?

Data admits precise, reproducible analysis that promises to "cut through the noise" and answer these questions for us within an internally consistent framework.

And it almost always delivers on this promise, furnishing us with the information we need to make better decisions and understand ourselves, our world, and the relationships that drive it.

But data gives us exactly what it promises and nothing more.

The internal consistency and mathematical precision that analysis offers can give license to a kind of epistemological hubris.

When we think analytically, we can only see our data points, our models, and the answers they suggest.   And soon enough we forget that the questions data answers are fundamentally **reductive**: categorization and regression flatten out all nuance and complexity *by design*

We all know this,The data points that matter become metrics, and, when we optimize on these metrics, they become our values. But with people oftentimes the "noise" we are trying to cut through is the most important part.

## Closing the Distance Between Data

But, as we bring data to bear on human questions, it is imperative to remember that

Of course, this is a feature and not a bug.

When we crush people down into a single row in a csv, when we reduce them to a vector in *n*-space

In particular, I think of data as a flattening of
all the complexity and nuance of reality onto a low
dimensional space.  

Sometimes, this flattening keeps most of the signal
