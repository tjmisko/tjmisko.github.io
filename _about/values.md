## Relational
- **Open-mindedness**: Seeking surprise, uncertainty, ambiguity, difference, and mystery in the Other. Minimizing surprise is tantamount to death; surprise is what is alive to us and for us.
- **Collaboration** & **Conversation**: Bringing people together to build things makes better things. Clear communication, respect, kindness, patience, and empathy are foundational for bringing people together. The best ideas are discovered and honed in conversation.
- **Groundedness**: Work, society, and the economy exist in service to people and the planet. Abstractions matter, but not as much as things do. Things matter, but not as much as creatures do.

## Personal
- **Curiosity**: People and things are interesting. Noticing what's interesting feels good and connects me to the world.
- **Experimentation**: The world is a complicated, messy place best learned about by trying things in it. Practicality protects prettiness from itself.
- **Persistence**: Working hard over long stretches and through difficult periods is how excellent things get built.
<!-- - **Sincerity** & **Playfulness**: -->
