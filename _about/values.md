## Relational
- **Open-mindedness**: Surprise, uncertainty, and discovery are delightful and to be sought out.
- **Collaboration and Conversation**: Bringing people together to build things makes better things. Clear communication, respect, kindness, patience, and empathy are foundational for bringing people together. The best ideas are discovered and honed in conversation.
- **Groundedness**: Work, society, and the economy exist in service to people and the planet. Abstractions matter, but not as much as creatures and things do.

## Personal
- **Curiosity**: People and things are interesting. Noticing what's interesting feels good and connects us to our world.
- **Experimentation**: The world in which we're embedded is a complicated, messy place best learned about by trying things in it. Practicality protects prettiness from itelf.
- **Persistence**: Working hard over long stretches and through difficult periods is how excellent things get built.
