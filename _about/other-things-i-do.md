## Swing Dancing

I started dancing at Lindy on Sproul, Berkeley's premier swing dancing venue, all the way back in 2019.  I was the Lindy on Sproul coordinator for 2 years as we revived the club post-COVID, and I'm still a regular attendee.  I love the dance, the music, and the community of people it brings out!  I'm currently focusing on expanding my repertoire and refining my technique as both a lead and a follow.  

## Climbing

I picked up bouldering in Summer 2022 and have been loving the progression. My goals for the year are to climb my first V7, get my top-roping and lead-climbing certifications, and climb outside somewhere.  For now, catch me stalking around the Touchstone Gyms in the Bay Area!

## Running

I ran a Boston Qualifying [2:59:33](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/872627/Course/1654891/Bib/1289) in the San Francisco marathon in July 2019, placing 3rd in the 19 and under category and 57th overall! Sadly, Boston wasn't in the cards for me that year :(

I also hold the dubious COVID-era honor of having completed a full 26.2 mile marathon in my house.... It took 7:31:42, 3020 laps around the foyer-kitchen-dinningroom loop, and a nontrival portion of the cartilage in my knees to complete.

I'm not training right now, but I look forward to improving my 800m, mile, 5K, and 10K times before my fast twitch muscle fiber deteriorates any more than it already has.  

## Guitar and Piano

I play guitar and piano casually and hold onto a fleeting hope to someday string some chords together into something mildly convincing.  Who knows?

## Calisthenics

I'll be honest, I've never really liked lifting or stretching as disciplines in themselves.  Calisthenics has been my newest project (I started in January 2023) and has me feeling really inspired to get strong and flexible!  My goals for the year are do five consecutive muscle ups, hold the human flag and the front lever for fifteen seconds each, master the handstand, and press a handstand.

## Cooking

I enjoy learning about the science of cooking and applying it in my kitchen.  I love cooking food with and for my friends and playing with different cuisines, flavors, and methods.  

## Coffee

I'm a bit of a coffee nerd.  As in, a bag of freshly roasted beans on me at all times kind of nerd.  My current setup is fully portable (hence the omnipresent beans): JX-Pro Manual Coffee Grinder from 1Zpresso and an Aeropress. Just add hot water!

## Rollercoasters

Well, I'm kind of a fake thoosie at this point, but my credit count is north of 100 and I have a [rankings spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DCDj14Vt9yC9ckRyAmXPKUrwRNkwWgCDpgSOGQznEsI/edit?usp=sharing), so I guess I still qualify.   Top 3 are [El Toro](https://rcdb.com/3183.htm), [Maverick](https://rcdb.com/3570.htm), and [I-305](https://rcdb.com/4520.htm).  Honorable mention goes to [Mean Streak](https://rcdb.com/16.htm).
