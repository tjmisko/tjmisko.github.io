## Swing Dancing

I started dancing at Lindy on Sproul, Berkeley's premier swing dancing venue, all the way back in 2019.  I was the Lindy on Sproul coordinator for 2 years as we revived the club post-COVID, and I'm still a regular attendee.  I love the dance, the music, and the community of people it brings out!

## Climbing

I picked up bouldering in Summer 2022 and have been loving the progression. My goals for the year are to climb my first V7, get my top-roping and lead-climbing certifications, and climb outside somewhere.  For now, catch me stalking around the Touchstone Gyms in the Bay Area!

## Running

I ran a Boston Qualifying [2:59:33](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/872627/Course/1654891/Bib/1289) in the San Francisco marathon in July 2019, placing 3rd in the 19 and under category and 57th overall! Sadly, Boston wasn't in the cards for me that year :(

I also hold the dubious COVID-era honor of having completed a full 26.2 mile marathon in my house.... It took 7:31:42, 3020 laps around the foyer-kitchen-dinningroom loop, and a nontrival portion of the cartilage in my knees to complete.

I'm not training right now, but I look forward to improving my 800m, mile, 5K, and 10K times before my fast twitch muscle fiber deteriorates any more than it already has.  

## Guitar

I play guitar casually and hold onto a fleeting hope to someday string some chords together into something mildly convincing.  Who knows?

## Calisthenics

I'll be honest, I've never really liked lifting or stretching.  Calisthenics has been my newest project (I started in January 2023) and has me feeling really inspired to get strong and flexible!  My goals for the year are do five consecutive muscle ups, hold the human flag and the front lever for fifteen seconds each, master the handstand, and press a handstand.
