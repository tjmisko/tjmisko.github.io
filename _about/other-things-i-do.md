## Swing Dancing
I started dancing at Lindy on Sproul, Berkeley's premier swing dancing venue, all the way back in 2019.  I was the Lindy on Sproul coordinator for 2 years as we revived the club post-COVID, and I'm still a regular attendee.  I love the dance, the music, and the community of people it brings out!  I'm currently focusing on expanding my repertoire and refining my technique as both a lead and a follow.  

## Climbing
I picked up bouldering in Summer 2022 and have been loving the progression. My goals for the year are to climb my first V7, get my top-roping and lead-climbing certifications, and climb outside somewhere.  For now, catch me stalking around the Touchstone Gyms in the Bay Area!

## Running
I ran a Boston Qualifying [2:59:33](https://www.athlinks.com/event/1403/results/Event/872627/Course/1654891/Bib/1289) in the San Francisco marathon in July 2019, placing 3rd in the 19 and under category and 57th overall! Sadly, Boston wasn't in the cards for me that year :(

I also hold the dubious COVID-era honor of having completed a full 26.2 mile marathon in my house.... It took 7:31:42, 3020 laps around the foyer-kitchen-dinningroom loop, and a nontrival portion of the cartilage in my knees to complete.

I'm not training right now, but I look forward to improving my 800m, mile, 5K, and 10K times before my fast twitch muscle fiber deteriorates any more than it already has.  

## Cooking
I enjoy learning about the science of cooking and applying it in my kitchen.  I love cooking food with and for my friends and playing with different cuisines, flavors, and methods.
