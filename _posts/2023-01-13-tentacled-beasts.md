Under no circumstances should one hunt a tentacled beast alone under the cover of darkness.

### Wednesday Morning, 2:14 AM
It's the middle of the night, but the coffee smells great and seems to be doing its job.  I'm pushing to finalize the SSPI Main Data File tonight, but it's looking like an uphill battle.  I'm producing charts for each of the indicators, clicking through to the source data, making sure everything is in order...and yes, it's sucking the life out of me, but my plan is to keep chugging through.  

My stuff[footnote: two jackets, a pen, a half-filled notebook, my laptop, a tangled mess of chargers, my Garmin (dead and hence removed from my wrist), my wallet, a crumpled up receipt from…Chipotle, the aforementioned cup of coffee, and the Aeropress whence it came] is spread out across the desks in the dimmed conference room at IRLE, and the white screen is definitely a few lumens too bright for my heavy, squinting eyes.  I suppose staying up late like this is a bad habit I developed in school.  My face certainly wasn’t unfamiliar to the late night cleaning crews at Moffitt.  The wee small hours of the morning were often generous to me growing up: paragraphs would seem to coalesce for me out of the darkness, and problem sets would usually submit to my will before the dawn.

But the darkness sure seems to be playing it coy tonight.  (Tonight? Today? This morning? None feel quite appropriate for the current time.  I guess there’s no word because there’s no sane reason to be awake at this unspeakable hour.)  I made a big checklist a few weeks back containing all the things that need to be done to finalize the data, and new checkboxes have been latching onto the bottom of the list much faster than I can pluck them off the top.  Where did that data come from? Didn’t we finish that last semester? Why is our documentation missing?  Great, the link is dead.  Etc., etc.

“Check into coal power data” is the most recent innocuous-sounding addition to the checklist, but the cheery generality of the phrasing doesn’t fool me the way it might have a few years ago.  In a few short hours, a many-tentacled monster will hatch from that egg, spreading out amoeba-like, sliding and squeezing its way into unexpected places, burrowing in and holding on with razor sharp sawtoothed suckers, and laying long delicate strings of pearlescent eggs.

The beasts back in school didn’t have tentacles.  Most were rather tame, actually.  Some were rather hairy: Multivariable Calculus problem sets were positively piliferous in my freshman year.  Others were slippery and slimey (Real Analysis).  Some were covered in quills (Complex Analysis), and some would wriggle and squirm something fierce (Greek Philosophy).  But despite their ugly features these beasts were usually manageable and at times even quite pleasurable to subdue, with the hunt requiring only a little grit and/or cleverness from me under the cover of darkness.  

### Wednesday Morning, 6:28 AM
I have left IRLE and walked to Blue Bottle to enlist the support of more caffeine, which this morning (the now-rising sun pins it down definitively as “this morning”) comes in the thick and fruity form of the Mexican Single Origin Espresso.  The only other customer here is an older man seated at the table next to me, talking loudly across the cafe at the barista, but saying the kind of wise-sounding platitudinous things that I’m ashamed to say still make me cringe despite my belief that they’re more or less true and exactly the kind of simple yet profound things that we in our busy and self-important lives usually need reminding of [footnote: link to DFW’s this is water].  The barista is doing his best to humor him but is starting to show some obvious irritation, to which the customer is either completely unaware or completely indifferent.  He might be homeless.  Unhoused.  The customer, I mean.  It’s the Bay, after all, so it’s probably necessary to clarify.  All of which is totally irrelevant filler serving mainly as cover to keep me from dealing with the hideous many-tentacled research monster hiding in my laptop right now.

Wednesday Morning, 6:30 AM
So anyway, here is the situation.  I worked on the Coal Power Indicator with one of my research mentees last semester.  She (apparently also a nocturnal hunter) and I met via Zoom to collect data after 11:00 PM on a March evening.  I’m looking at our data collection Google Sheet from last semester, and, frankly speaking, it’s not particularly subtle in its indication that it was put together by two overtired undergraduates in the middle of the night.  The formatting is inconsistent, and the sourcing isn’t super clear, but I think I remember that the organization we settled on was IEA, and a quick look at the indicator table confirms this.

Navigation to the IEA site brings me to a front page that immediately fills me with a vague sense of dread.  It’s like walking into a room you’ve bombed an exam in, or maybe like accidentally opening a file for a big assignment you were stressed about but failed to finish in time.  I’m poking around the site and looking for a link to an API, a data download, something…. Further unpleasant memories involving reading data values off of graphs and lots of mindless repetitive tasks are bubbling up in my head.  More poking and some circuitous link paths bring me to the charts I’m recalling.  They present time series data on all sorts of energy indicators including the Total Energy Supply by Source.

Next to the chart there is a really friendly looking blue button that says “Download Chart Data,” but it’s graced with a considerably less friendly looking asterisk which helpfully clarifies in small font at the bottom of the page that “free data is only available for download in 5-year intervals” (italics obviously in my head).  Further inquiry leads me to a page from which you can purchase the full dataset for the absolutely reasonable price of $600 plus tax.  Hopefully they throw in shipping and handling with that, too.  

Which let me tell you is incredibly annoying and honestly a little bit offensive because the data I need is published in the chart I’m looking at in one year intervals, and you can literally hover over the chart to get the exact value for each of the individual years if you’re careful with your mouse positioning, which is just dangling the numbers in front of me and betting that I am too lazy to transcribe them by hand.  It’s like when you’re a kid and somebody tall taunts you by holding something you want just out of reach.  If you’re going to make the numbers available at all, why not just publish them in the downloadable sheet instead of going out of your way to filter out 80% of the values in your chart and then hiding the rest of them behind a paywall? I’m convinced it’s just to fuck with me, personally.

The younger manager in me encountered this situation nine months ago, probably experienced some similar indignation, and eventually came to the conclusion that something like this was a great opportunity for teamwork, so I got my mentee on call, and we trudged painstakingly through all the countries, in this case highlighting and copying the six or seven digit number (it turns out countries use an ungodly amount of TerraJoules of energy).  After all, I got my start on the SSPI tediously collecting lots of data, and if that’s how I came up, surely that’s the best way…

This is how the aforementioned mess of a spreadsheet I was looking at got produced.  The trouble now is that the values in the sheet we collected, seem to be in BTU, but everything on the IEA site is in TJ, so they’ve probably updated their data and changed units or else I’m looking at the wrong source.  Either way, we are using untraceable data that no longer replicates, which simply does not fly, and so it must be collected again, by me, right now, alone.

I’ll leave the volume and timbre of the sigh I am heaving right now to your imagination.

Under no circumstances should one hunt a tentacled beast alone under the cover of darkness.  Or, for that matter, at dawn.

### Wednesday Afternoon, 3:10 PM
I’ve just finished my last official meeting as SSPI team leader, although I trust will not be the last meeting I run for the team.  I obviously didn’t finish the data last night, but all in all I’m really pleased with how things have gone this semester.  

In August, nine new undergraduates joined the SSPI team as research apprentices.  Onboarding is a challenge always and everywhere, and the SSPI is no exception.  In previous semesters, we’ve assigned the new team members to read the working paper and have tried to “ramp them up” with some easy assignments, but it’s not uncommon for the new apprentices to feel a little bit paralyzed and unsure when faced with their first few real assignments.  I certainly felt that way when I started.  As it turns out, most wild beasts have tentacles, and it can be a bit intimidating to encounter them at first.

Early in the semester, a couple of my mentees were worried about working with data and expressed concern about whether they had enough experience to make a valuable contribution to the team.  The conversations I had with them really changed the way I approached my role as a research mentor this semester, and I think it  

In previous semesters, I think Professor Brown and I have assumed that the students coming in have some foundational econometrics and data science knowledge, but the reality is that the UC Berkeley Economics department emphasizes theory, and lots (perhaps most) Economics Majors at Cal graduate without ever running a regression.  The economics degree at Cal is depressingly analogous to a Computer Science department that teaches only discrete math and algorithms classes and presents some examples of production-grade software projects and tries to explain how they work without ever having the students actually plan, write, or test a line of their own code.  ECON 140 and 141 (UC Berkeley’s main econometrics offerings) are particularly poorly designed for students looking to do research.  They focus on interpretation of regression results and proving theorems, which I suppose makes exams and assignments easy to grade, but it leaves most students completely unprepared to apply what they have learned in a practical setting.  And honestly, who else would be taking undergraduate econometrics courses except students interested in doing research?  In this day and age, I think most economics classes (and especially econometrics classes) should involve looking at, sorting, filtering, and analyzing data to get students reinforcing, applying, and maybe even discovering for themselves the concepts they’re learning in class.  

To bridge this skill gap, I put together some tutorial videos for the basic tools, skills, and concepts we use over and over again on the SSPI, like the advanced uses of spreadsheets, regressions, data cleaning, and using REST APIs to get data.  I spent time working through problems with students at Office Hours.  I tried my best to make myself available for long, unstructured blocks of time.  It took some patience and planning to feel confident spending as much time as I did on training and mentoring, but the results from this semester confirm that the investment has really paid off.  I’m really pleased by the quality and thoughtfulness of the work that these students have done in the last few weeks.  They’ve approached problems in unique ways, dug into the sources and definitions of data, and done excellent work with the tools we spent so much time learning at the beginning of the semester.  

All of that’s great and all, but it begs the question: what was I doing, awake at unspeakable hours, hunting tentacled beasts under the cover of darkness?

### Wednesday Afternoon, 3:23 PM





The biggest thing I learned this semester was Invest in and trust my team.  Listen to their needs, what’s working for them and what isn’t.  Help them learn what they need to know them what they need to know.  

End of semester reflection
* Much more time on training
* How does this story relate to what I’ve learned
    * I’m still learning.  

I spent the first couple weeks of the semester getting these tutorials out, talking through issues the students were running into

I’ve always been drawn to teaching and tutoring, so these were actually quite fun to put together for me.

	Of course, you can take this can-do attitude too far.  You might even get the urge to go hunting tentacled beasts alone under the cover of darkness.  

Wednesday Morning, 7:15 AM

Most real beasts have tentacles.

Scene One: IRLE in the middle of the night, coffee smell, dim lights and lurid white screens; long checklist keeps getting longer; tired, a little bit frustrated but putting my head down; hitting a wall with coal power is frustrating
* it was a terrible idea to lone wolf this
* classic example of a parallel set of projects when i need to trust my team to do a good job

Scene Two: Blue bottle. i've gotten a wink of sleep and now it's time to push through coal power.  the main data file for the site seems to be behind a 600 USD paywall which is terribly frustrating.  they have graphs
* this felt so good to work through
* requires the attention of one (or maybe a pair) of people
* before pur team pushed through by using man power to grind out hand collection
* lone wolf works really well here

Scene Three: team meeting, giving assignments,
plotline: i'm stressed out and up all night trying to finish things up, and ultimately i can't get everything done.  i go to our team meeting and people are asking great questions, and are going to do great, which is reassuring.  the next day, i'm reflecting and writing.  i've got to trust them, not put it all on myself.  
* what i’ve learned about management:



themes:
* trust your team
    * i want to do it all myself: every ambitious 20 something has that impulse
* training pays off
* investment in a project helps you learn
* working alone vs collaborating
    * slow to collaborate sometimes: you always have to invest time to build understanding
    * talking through something takes a long time, but usually produces better results
    * need both to get things done
* complexity piles up on itself
    * prof card said that and it stuck with me everything in economics takes three times as long as you think it will
    * the to do list grows faster than the items can be checked off
maybe every twenty-something has to learn the lesson that big complex projects always require collaboration.  i g

  [footnote: I encourage the reader to navigate there as well and see if you can find where to download the data for Total Energy Consumption by source: if you can find it (and it probably is there somewhere), I imagine you’ll experience a perverse kind of schadenfreude while reading the rest of this post that I personally wouldn’t want to miss out on.]  





This previous semester (August 2022 - December 2022) has been the most productive by far.





* i've been working as the project manager since august 2021, but this semester has been the most productive by far
    * i spent a lot more time training people than in previous semesters
        * training allows better delegation
        * a little basic training means you can give people a more complex task and they won't feel like they're drowning, and they'll come back and surprise you with excellent work
        * not havving the basic skills makes you feel like you're drowning, like you're helpless
        * why do we assume that people will have these skills?
    * students come in with too much theory and not enough practice
        * thoughts on the berkeley economics department
        * theme of school being not as good as working on a project
        * proposal for a more general shift in focus in education?
    * made videos which will be relevant to sspi work going forward and can be use
    * what makes a good team? good culture, good people, open communication, in person really helps!
* learning to trust your team: i feel like i need to ramp up to finish, but i should trust the investments i've made in the team
    * thanks so much to the team this semester, it's been a pleasure working with you!


data values have no units indicated except on the one incomplete sheet of the six in the document (viz. “eia” is the incomplete sheet of the bunch of six titled, in order: “eia,” “consumption,” “Sheet 7,” “Sheet 1,” “electricity coal,” and “New total production”).
