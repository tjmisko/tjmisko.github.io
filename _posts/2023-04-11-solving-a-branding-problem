*Quasioptimal* is my imperfect solution to an explicit design problem.  I spent a few afternoons workshopping it and tossing some other names around.[^1]  I wanted brand name that was (1) a suggestive word or phrase that (2) resonated with me, (3) was general enough to put to any number of evolving uses, and (4) wasn’t already in wide use.

These constraints were informed by some examples I know well from the podcasting world and the blogosphere.  My entry point into podcast listening back in high school was Hello Internet, which at one point or another featured an explicit discussion of how they came to their name that sketched some similar considerations above list of design constraints.[^2]   From that show I branched out to Cortex, then to *[ATP](https://atp.fm/)*, *[Upgrade](https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/)*, and *[Reconcilable Differences](https://www.relay.fm/rd)*.  I don’t listen to any of these shows these days, but they formed an indelible part of my late adolescence, and I think back on them with great fondness, as you might an old friend from grade school whom you don’t see much anymore.  

The most direct model for the name *Quasioptimal* came from John Siracusa, a cohost of ATP and *Reconcilable Differences*, who writes a blog called *Hypercritical*.[^3] I think a title like Hypercritcal is great because it gestures at an approach and tone characteristic of John Siracusa without being topically restrictive, leaving him a lot of leeway to write about whatever he’s interested in.  It would be weird if the China History Podcast, of which I’m also a listener, started producing shows about the electric vehicle market in Sweden or the pop music scene in Uzbekistan or Lazlo Montgomery’s decision-making process when buying a sofa.  But Hypercritical might cover anything from the technical details of Apple products to Destiny music videos to broader musings about the tech industry, and anything else besides.  It ties the brand to the voice and approach of the writer, not on the content of their writing.  

For a project like mine, the content of which is developing and evolving (slowly, alas), finding my version of Hypercritical that could grow and change with me without losing its relevance or feeling like a burden down the line was crucial.

[^1]: The closest runner up was something about the concept of *meliorization* as contrasted with the idea of *optimization*.  Both words betray the  years of my adolescence I spent nerding out in Latin class.  Both focus on the notion of being near or approaching an optimum, which is the core of the recurring set of observations that will come about in quasioptimal.

[^3]: To be honest, I haven't actually read much of *[Hypercritical](https://hypercritical.co/)*; I just really like the name.
