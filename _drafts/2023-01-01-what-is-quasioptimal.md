## The Pareto Principle and Diminishing Returns

## Choosing a Brand

## Beliefs vs. Values

## What I Want This Space To Be

## The Value of Thinking in "Public"

I want to state clearly that I'm not trying to convince a reader of Quasioptimal to agree with me *per se*.  Sure, I must think my arguments have some merit if I'm taking all this time in writing them, and sure, I do think I'm right almost certainly more often than I am right.

What the blogosphere offers for me in 2023 is not publicity or reach or influence.  It offers instead the mere possibility that my work will be read, which forces me to think differently.  It makes me question my assumptions.  It makes me run arguments that have become so familiar to me that they are second nature through filter of skepticism.  It forces me to try not to drone on for too long or get too diverted in my arguments (both of these are bad habits of mine).  

I don't really mind nobody takes much note of Quasioptimal.  I don't expect it to go anywhere.  All I want is a space to work and play with words and ideas.  I want to experiment with form, content, and style.  And the public nature of a blog affords me this space.
